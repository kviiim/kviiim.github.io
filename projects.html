                        This was a project at Southwest Research Institute that I contributed to as an intern. The overall objective of the project was to develop a robot motion planning system that responds to the position of a human in real-time, to allow for more safe human-robot interactions.
                        I primarily contributed to the integration of the system - building the pathway for communication between the human motion capture system and the real-time path planning system. 
                        I worked with ROS and C++ to create the human model in the path planning collision model which is shown above.

                    <p>
                        This is an OpenCV food catching game utilizing dlib for face identification.
                        The game identifies any faces within a webcam frame and uses that information to let players "eat" food images on screen. The project included two versions of the FoodFest game:
                        Static food, in which food appears on the screen and remains in one location and the game never ends.
                        And falling food: where the has food, poison, and hearts which fall from the top of the screen. The player must catch food, and avoid poison, otherwise they lose a life. The game ends when the player loses three lives, however until that point they can regain lives by eating hearts. There is no way to win the game.

                    <p>Our project goal was to use C++ and OpenCV to get input from a user, and use that input to perform a task. We tracked a color target to allow the user to "paint" in the air, as seen above. We included various painting options and how to allow the user to choose them, including allowing the user to select different colors and line thicknesses. We explored tracking a users hand, but found that our accuracy and runtime were not high enough for our end application.

                    <p>
                        Used opencv to track yellow game pieces as part of a project for FIRST Robotics Team 1511. Isolated the largest cluster of
                        pixels that were within the yellow color range to identify the nearest cube, and then used the position
                        in the frame to adjust the robot path to the game piece. The code also would proportionally adjust speed
                        based on the distance of the target, so it would collide with the cube at a speed that would potentially 
                        damage the robot. This would allow the robot to autonomously aquire game pieces during a match.<br>

                    <p>
                        Wrote a simple model of planes moving between airports. For each simulation a schedule of
                        flights was generated, where each airplane in the model moved to an airport, waited a specific amount of time simulating preparing
                        the plane for flight, and then moved to the next airport. We then ran two versions of the model, once with no delays, and once 
                        with a 'storm' or - delays causing any flights arriving or leaving from an airport for a set period of time. We then viewed how
                        this delay impacted the rest of our flight schedule. While the model showed delays, it didn't completely mirror the long term effects
                        that one sees in reality, however this was probably a result of some of the simplifications we made.

                    <p>Modeled the force required for a person to hang off of a ferris wheel as it moved. This project was inspired by the scene in <i>The 
                        Notebook</i> in which Noah - Ryan Gosling - hangs off of the ferris wheel that his love interest is on while asking her out. We wanted
                        to determine what the maximum speed the ferris wheel could spin at before it overcame our estimate of Ryan Goslings grip strength and 
                        ejected him from the ferris wheel.
