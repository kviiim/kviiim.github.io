                    <p>
                        Used opencv to track yellow game pieces as part of a project for FIRST Robotics Team 1511. Isolated the largest cluster of
                        pixels that were within the yellow color range to identify the nearest cube, and then used the position
                        in the frame to adjust the robot path to the game piece. The code also would proportionally adjust speed
                        based on the distance of the target, so it would collide with the cube at a speed that would potentially 
                        damage the robot. This would allow the robot to autonomously aquire game pieces during a match.<br>

                    <p>
                        Wrote a simple model of planes moving between airports. For each simulation a schedule of
                        flights was generated, where each airplane in the model moved to an airport, waited a specific amount of time simulating preparing
                        the plane for flight, and then moved to the next airport. We then ran two versions of the model, once with no delays, and once 
                        with a 'storm' or - delays causing any flights arriving or leaving from an airport for a set period of time. We then viewed how
                        this delay impacted the rest of our flight schedule. While the model showed delays, it didn't completely mirror the long term effects
                        that one sees in reality, however this was probably a result of some of the simplifications we made.

                    <p>Modeled the force required for a person to hang off of a ferris wheel as it moved. This project was inspired by the scene in <i>The 
                        Notebook</i> in which Noah - Ryan Gosling - hangs off of the ferris wheel that his love interest is on while asking her out. We wanted
                        to determine what the maximum speed the ferris wheel could spin at before it overcame our estimate of Ryan Goslings grip strength and 
                        ejected him from the ferris wheel.
